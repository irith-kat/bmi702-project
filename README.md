# Autonomous Phenotyping for Clinical Research Workflows
The goal of this project is to build a "phenotyping-as-a-service" MCP server that operationalizes KOMAP and LATTE as MCP tools to enable better autonomous workflows for end-to-end clinical research.

Accurate cohort definition remains a major challenge in EHR-based research studies, as diagnostic billing codes alone often fail to reflect true clinical phenotypes. While KOMAP (multimodal weakly supervised phenotyping) and LATTE (longitudinal incident phenotyping) address these limitations, they currently require manual configuration and technical expertise. By exposing these algorithms as callable tools, this system enables LLM-based agents to perform multimodal and longitudinal phenotyping beyond simple code-based filtering, supporting more accurate and reproducible end-to-end clinical research workflows. This project will use the MIMIC-IV dataset (https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/) and build off of the data access MCP infrastructure that M4 (https://github.com/hannesill/m4/tree/main) has established, and extend the agent's capabilities from heuristic cohort selection to advanced phenotyping.
