# bmi702-project
Our project idea is to develop a multi-agentic system that allows clinical researchers to conduct end-to-end target trial emulation studies on MIMIC-IV, with human-in-the-loop intervention at each step. Our work will build off of M4 (https://github.com/hannesill/m4/tree/main) for AI-assisted clinical research, which is an agentic system for defining cohorts, computing statistics, and visualizing distributions on top of EHR datasets (so far: MIMIC-IV, eICU). The core innovation lies in bridging the gap between automated cohort discovery (which M4 already handles) and rigorous statistical estimation of treatment effects (which has not been done before agentically). By automating the TTE workflow, we can reduce the technical barrier for clinicians to conduct rigorous causal research, ensuring that AI-generated clinical insights follow established epidemiological best practices. We plan to evaluate our system by attempting to recreate the results from existing TTE papers on MIMIC-IV.
